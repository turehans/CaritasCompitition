  <h1>What is Kaitiakitanga </h1>
<h5>Kaitiakitanga is a Māori word that means guardianship and protection. A core Māori value 
  and belief it is a way of managing the environment, based on the Māori world view. <br>
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
  As Humans the Māori believe that we are the Kitiaki, the guardians.
   That as humans we have been given the role to care for the area we live in.
    The Māori often do this has an Iwi. But as part of Caritas, we can also care about the area around us.
   This is one of Caritas’s core values. <bold>Stewardship</bold> of the land. 
</h5>
<br> 

<h5>
  At the moment the biggest act of Kaitiakitanga around the world is how we are
   trying to fix climate change.We do this because we want to care for the environment
   around us and try to make a difference for the <bold>Common Good</bold> of all. 
</h5>
 <br> 
 <h5>
  The Māori also believe that we all need to do this as a
   large group will make a much larger difference than a small one. This is 
   another core Caritas Value. <bold>Participation</bold> recognizes that that everyone
    has a part to play in our communities and that we each have something unique and 
    important to contribute to society.
   Because of this Caritas wants us all to be active members of our local and global communities.
