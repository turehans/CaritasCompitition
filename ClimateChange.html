  <h1>What is Climate Change</h1>
<h5>Climate change the changes in the environment that are being created by humans and over population.
It is created by Humans using to many resources and damaging over environment by polluting and destroying the earth by burning fossil fuels and releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. <br>
<br>
The sudden rise is temperature rises had just started since the Industrial Revolution. With temperatures rising by 0.2 degrees every year. Because of this climate scientists have concluded that we must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 if we are to avoid a future in which everyday life around the world is marked by its worst, most devastating effects: the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters
</h5>

  <h1>Stats about Climate Change</h1>

  <h5>At 416 part​s per million the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere is the highest it has been in human history.</5>
  <h5>Analysis shows that average global temperatures in 2020 were 1.76 degrees F (0.98 degrees C) warmer than the 20th century average — making it the second-hottest year on record. In fact, the seven warmest years in the 1880-2020 record have all occurred since 2014.</h5>
<h5>Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation — comparable to the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet.</h5>  
<h5>Tropical forests are incredibly effective at storing carbon, providing at least a third of the mitigation action needed to prevent the worst climate change scenarios. Yet nature-based solutions receive only 3% of all climate funding.</h5>
<h5>Natural climate solutions such as restoring degraded forests could create as many as 39 jobs per million dollars spent — that's a job-creation rate more than six times higher than the oil and gas industry.</h5>
